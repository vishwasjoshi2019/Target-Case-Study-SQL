# Problem Statement:
## In-depth Exploration:
- # Is there a growing trend in the no. of orders placed over the past years?
```sql
   select extract(year from order_purchase_timestamp)as year, count(order_id)
  from `target_SQL.orders`
  group by (year) order by year;
```

- # Can we see some kind of monthly seasonality in terms of the no. of orders being placed?

 ```sql
select month,
avg(no_of_orders) as avg_order_count from
(select extract(month from order_purchase_timestamp)
as month,count(order_id) as no_of_orders
from target_SQL.orders group by month )
group by month
order by avg_order_count desc
```
- # During what time of the day, do the Brazilian customers mostly place their orders? (Dawn, Morning, Afternoon or Night)
  - 0-6 hrs : Dawn
  - 7-12 hrs : Mornings
  - 13-18 hrs : Afternoon
  - 19-23 hrs : Night

```sql
with CTE as (
select extract(hour from order_purchase_timestamp) as day_hour,
order_id
from target_SQL.orders
)
select
case when day_hour between 0 and 6 then "Dawn"
when day_hour between 7 and 12 then "Morning"
when day_hour between 13 and 18 then "Afternoon"
when day_hour between 19 and 23 then "Night"
End as day_time,
count( distinct order_id) as order_count,
from CTE
group by day_time

```
