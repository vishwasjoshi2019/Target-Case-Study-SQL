# Problem Statement:
## Analysis based on sales, freight and delivery time.
- ### Find the no. of days taken to deliver each order from the orderâ€™s purchase date as delivery time.
  ### Also, calculate the difference (in days) between the estimated & actual delivery date of an order. Do this in a single query. You can calculate the delivery time and the difference between the estimated & actual delivery date using the given formula:
  ### time_to_deliver = order_delivered_customer_date - order_purchase_timestamp
  ### diff_estimated_delivery = order_estimated_delivery_date - order_delivered_customer_date
```sql
select order_id,
abs(date_diff(order_delivered_customer_date,order_purchase_timestamp,day))
as time_to_deliver,
abs(date_diff(order_estimated_delivery_date
,order_delivered_customer_date,day)) as diff_estimated_delivery
from target_SQL.orders

```

- ### Find out the top 5 states with the highest & lowest average freight value.

 ```sql
WITH CTE AS (
SELECT c.customer_state,AVG(oi.freight_value) AS average_value,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY AVG(oi.freight_value)) AS asc_rnk,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY AVG(oi.freight_value) DESC) AS desc_rnk
FROM target_SQL.customers c
JOIN target_SQL.orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN target_SQL.order_items oi
ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
GROUP BY c.customer_state
)
SELECT
T1.customer_state,T1.average_value AS lowest_average_value,
T2.customer_state,T2.average_value AS highest_average_value
FROM (
SELECT customer_state,average_value,asc_rnk
FROM CTE
ORDER BY average_value LIMIT 5
) AS T1
FULL JOIN (
SELECT customer_state, average_value,desc_rnk
FROM CTE
ORDER BY average_value DESC LIMIT 5
) AS T2
ON T1.asc_rnk = T2.desc_rnk
ORDER BY COALESCE(T1.asc_rnk, T2.desc_rnk);
```

- ### Find out the top 5 states with the highest & lowest average delivery time.

 ```sql
WITH CTE AS (
SELECT c.customer_state,
AVG(date_diff(order_delivered_customer_date,order_purchase_timestamp,day))
AS average_deliver_time,
FROM target_SQL.customers c
JOIN target_SQL.orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_state
)
SELECT
T1.customer_state,T1.average_deliver_time AS lowest_deliver_time,
T2.customer_state,T2.average_deliver_time AS highest_deliver_time
FROM (
SELECT customer_state,average_deliver_time,
row_number() over(order by average_deliver_time) as asc_rnk
FROM CTE
LIMIT 5
) AS T1
FULL JOIN (
SELECT customer_state, average_deliver_time,
row_number() over(order by average_deliver_time desc) as desc_rnk
FROM CTE
LIMIT 5
) AS T2

ON T1.asc_rnk = T2.desc_rnk
ORDER BY COALESCE(T1.asc_rnk, T2.desc_rnk);

```

- ### Find out the top 5 states where the order delivery is really fast as compared to the estimated date of delivery.
  ### You can use the difference between the averages of actual & estimated delivery date to figure out how fast the delivery was for each state.

```sql
with CTE as(
select
c.customer_state,avg(abs(date_diff(date(o.order_delivered_customer_date),da
te(o.order_purchase_timestamp),day))) as avg_delivered_date,
avg(abs(date_diff(date(o.order_estimated_delivery_date),date(o.order_purcha
se_timestamp),day))) as avg_estimated_date
from target_SQL.orders o
join target_SQL.customers c
on o.customer_id=c.customer_id
group by c.customer_state
)
select customer_state,avg_estimated_date-avg_delivered_date as
fast_delivery
from CTE order by fast_delivery desc limit 5;
```
